# doctor, browser

HyperFrames-specific browser and render-runtime diagnosis. This is not the
VidMuse media/environment preflight and must not run from plugin setup.

For general media health, authentication, plan, model catalog, Node.js,
`ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe`, run `/media-use` `scripts/resolve.mjs --doctor`.
Continue here only when a concrete HyperFrames composition, browser, preview,
or render failure identifies the HyperFrames runtime.

## doctor

```bash
npx hyperframes doctor
npx hyperframes doctor --json     # CI / agent output (always exit 0; gate on payload `ok`)
```

Runs independent checks and reports each as ok/warn/fail:

- **Version** — installed CLI vs latest on npm (hints upgrade when stale)
- **Node.js** — ≥ 22 required
- **CPU**, **Memory**, **Disk** — host resources
- **Environment** — env vars that affect the renderer
- **FFmpeg** / **FFprobe** — found, version, codecs
- **Chrome** — bundled or system, version, path
- **Docker** / **Docker running** — required only for `render --docker`
- **/dev/shm** — inside containers only

Run this scoped `doctor` when:

- `render` fails with a Chrome or FFmpeg error.
- `preview` opens but the composition fails to load.
- An explicitly requested HyperFrames composition render needs its browser
  runtime checked.

Common issues:

- **Missing FFmpeg** — install via `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or your package manager.
- **Missing bundled Chrome** — run `npx hyperframes browser ensure`.
- **Low memory** — close other Chromes, reduce `--workers`, or use `--quality draft`.
- **Chrome exits instantly inside an agent sandbox (macOS)** — seatbelt-style sandboxes
  (e.g. codex `workspace-write`) block Chromium's Mach port bootstrap
  (`MachPortRendezvous`; openai/codex#21292), so every Chrome — bundled, system, or
  headless shell — dies at startup. This is a host-level block, not a HyperFrames or
  Chrome install problem: compile checks and audio still pass, only rendering is
  unavailable. State the blocker and deliver the checked composition; render outside the
  sandbox or via `render --docker` / cloud rendering where available. **Do not build a
  substitute rasterizer** (magick/PIL/SVG frame pipelines) — on a blocked-browser host
  the deliverable IS the checked composition plus this blocker note, and rendering is
  handed to `--docker`, cloud, or the user. Write your final summary the moment the
  blocker is identified, BEFORE any optional fallback work: a later session failure must
  not erase the report of work already done.

## browser

```bash
npx hyperframes browser ensure    # find or download the pinned Chrome
npx hyperframes browser path      # print the browser executable path (for scripting)
npx hyperframes browser clear     # remove the cached Chrome download
```

Manage the Chrome build HyperFrames uses for rendering. The pinned version exists because pixel output drifts across Chrome versions — using the bundled build keeps rendered output reproducible across machines.

Use `path` to embed the binary in scripts: `$(npx hyperframes browser path)`.
